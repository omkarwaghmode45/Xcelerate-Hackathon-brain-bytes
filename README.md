\# Automated Boundary Integrity Monitoring System (ABIMS)



\## 🚀 Project Overview

This project was developed for Xcelerate Hackathon.



ABIMS is a web-based system designed to monitor large industrial land boundaries and detect structural changes or illegal encroachments using periodic image scanning and automated comparison techniques.



---



\## 🎯 Problem Statement

Monitoring large industrial boundaries manually is inefficient and costly. There is a need for an automated system that detects boundary shifts, illegal construction, or land encroachment in a scalable and cost-effective manner.



---



\## 💡 Proposed Solution

The system:

\- Uses periodic boundary image scanning

\- Compares current images with baseline references

\- Detects structural changes

\- Generates alerts for government officers and land owners

\- Provides role-based dashboards
